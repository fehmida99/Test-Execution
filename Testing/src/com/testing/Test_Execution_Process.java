/*### Test Execution Process

The test Execution technique consists of three different phases which will be carried out to process the test result and ensure the correctness of the required results. In each phase, various activities or work will be carried out by various team members. The three main phases of test execution are the creation of test cases, test case execution, and validation of test results. Let us discuss each phase.

**1. Creation of Test Cases:** The first phase is to create suitable test cases for each module or function. Here, the tester with good domain knowledge must be required to create suitable test cases. It is always preferable to create simple test cases and the creation of test cases should not be delayed else it will cause excess time to release the product. The created test cases should not be repeated again. It should cover all the possible scenarios raised in the application.

**2. Test Cases Execution:** After test cases have been created, execution of test cases will take place. Here, the Quality Analyst team will either do automated or manual testing depending upon the test case scenario. It is always preferable to do both automated as well as manual testing to have 100% assurance of correctness. The selection of testing tools is also important to execute the test cases.

**3. Validating Test Results:** After executing the test cases, note down the results of each test case in a separate file or report. Check whether the executed test cases achieved the expected result and record the time required to complete each test case i.e., measure the performance of each test case. If any of the test cases is failed or not satisfied the condition then report it to the development team for validating the code.*/
