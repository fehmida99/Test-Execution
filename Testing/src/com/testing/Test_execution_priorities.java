/*### Test Execution Priorities

Test Execution Priorities are nothing but prioritizing the test cases depending upon several factors. It means that it executes the test cases with high efficient first than the other test cases. It depends upon various factors. Let us discuss some of the factors to be considered while prioritizing the test cases.

- **Complexity:** The complexity of the test cases can be determined by including several factors such as boundary values of test cases, features or components of test cases, data entry of test cases, and how much the test cases cover the given business problem.
- **Risk Covered:** How much risk that a certain test case may undergo to achieve the result. Risk in the form of time required to complete the test case process, space complexity whether it is executed in the given memory space, etc.,
- **Platforms Covered:** It simply tells that in which platform or operating system the test cases have been executed i.e., test cases executed in the Windows OS, Mac OS, Mobile OS, etc.,
- **Depth:** It covers how depth the given test cases cover each functionality or module in the application i.e., how much a given test procedure covers all the possible conditions in a single functionality or module.
- **Breadth:** It covers how the breadth of the given test cases covers the entire functionality or modules in the application i.e., how much a given test procedure covers all the possible conditions in the entire functionality or modules in the product or application.*/
