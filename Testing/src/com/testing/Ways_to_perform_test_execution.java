/*### Ways to Perform Test Execution

Testers can choose from the below list of preferred methods to carry out test execution:

1. **Run test cases:** It is a simple and easiest approach to run test cases on the local machine and it can be coupled with other artifacts like test plans, test suites, test environments, etc.
2. **Run test suites:** A test suite is a collection of manual and automated test cases and the test cases can be executed sequentially or in parallel. Sequential execution is useful in cases where the result of the last test case depends on the success of the current test case.
3. **Run test case execution and test suite execution records:** Recording test case execution and test suite execution is a key activity in the test process and helps to reduce errors, making the testing process more efficient.
4. **Generate test results without execution:** Generating test results from non-executed test cases can be helpful in achieving comprehensive test coverage.
5. **Modify execution variables:** Execution variables can be modified in the test scripts for particular test runs.
6. **Run automated and manual tests:** Test execution can be done manually or can be automated.
7. **Schedule test artifacts:** Test artifacts include video, screenshots, data reports, etc. These are very helpful as they document the results of the past test execution and provide information about what needs to be done in future test execution.
8. **Defect tracking:** Without defect tracking test execution is not possible, as during testing one should be able to track the defects and identify what when wrong and where.*/
