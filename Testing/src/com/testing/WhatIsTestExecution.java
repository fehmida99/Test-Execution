	/*### What is Test Execution?

			Test Execution is the process of executing the tests written by the tester to check whether the developed code or functions or modules are providing the expected result as per the client requirement or business requirement. Test Execution comes under one of the phases of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC).

			In the test execution process, the tester will usually write or execute a certain number of test cases, and test scripts or do automated testing. If it creates any errors then it will be informed to the respective development team to correct the issues in the code. If the text execution process shows successful results then it will be ready for the deployment phase after the proper setup for the deployment environment.*/
